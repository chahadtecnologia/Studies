## Cluster Architecture, Installation, and Configuration

This includes understanding the basic architecture of a Kubernetes clusters such as control plane versus worker nodes, high-availabiltity setups, and the tooling for installing, upgrading, and maintaining a cluster.

## Workloads and Scheduling

You need to be familiar with Deployments, ReplicaSets, and configuration data specified by ConfigMaps and Secrets.

## Services and Networking

Understanding Pod-to-Pod communication, exposing applications outside of the cluster, and configuring cluster networking is extremely important to administrators to ensure a functioning system (Service and Ingress).

## Storage

You will need to be familiar with the mechanics and demostrate how to mount a persistent volume to a path in a container. 

## Troubleshooting 

This section of the exam has the highest scoring weight. You will be confronted with typical scenarios that you need to fix by taking appropriate measures.

## Candidate Skills

The certification assumes that you already have a basic understanding of Kubernetes.

- **Kubernetes architecture and concepts** = The exam may ask you to install a Kubernetes cluster from scratch. 

- **Kubectl command-line tool** = The *kubectl* command-line tool is the central tool you will use during the exam to interact with Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, you need to have a good understanding of the tool *etcdctl* including its command-line options for backing up and restoring the etcd database. 

- **Other relevants tools** = Ensure that you have a good handle on basic YAML syntax, data types, and indentation conforming to the specification.
